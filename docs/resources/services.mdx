# Services

The service resource allows you to define and manage services that can be used by machines or by the public internet. Services are independent of the machine lifecycle, so they can be created, updated, and deleted without affecting the machines that use them.

If you want to know how to deploy a a service [Building and Deploying &gt; Deploying](../building-and-deploying/deploying.md).

## Configuration

| Property                      | Type            | Required |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------- | :------: |
| `namespace`                   | `string`        |          |
| [`name`](#name)               | `string`        |    ✓     |
| [`tags`](#tags)               | `array<string>` |          |
| [`bind`](#bindings)           | `object`        |    ✓     |
| [`target`](#target)           | `object`        |    ✓     |
| [`certificate`](#certificate) | `string`        |          |

If you want to know more about namespaces, check [Building and Deploying &gt; Namespaces](../building-and-deploying/namespaces.md)

### Name

The name is the unique identifier for your service within a namespace.

<ResourceNameValidation />

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  name: terminator-service
```

### Tags

Tags are used to organize and categorize resources. They can be any valid UTF-8 string and can be used to filter resources in the [Web Console](../monitoring/web-console.md).

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  tags:
    - terminator
```

### Bindings

It defines how the service is exposed. It can be either [`internal`](#internal) or [`external`](#external).

#### Internal

It exposes the service only internally on the tenant. It is used for inter-machine communication.

| Property | Type                          |         Default          |
| :------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------: |
| `port`   | `int` (min: `0` max: `65535`) | The [target port](#port) |

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  bind:
    internal: {}
```

In order to access the service within a machine you need to use the following http url:

```text
http://<service>.<namespace>.svc.lttle.local:<port>
```

If you want to define a specific port you can do it like this:

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  namespace: robot
  name: terminator-service
  bind:
    internal:
      port: 8080
```

And the URL will be:

```text
http://terminator-service.robot.svc.lttle.local:8080
```

All services are scoped within a [tenant](../glossary.md#tenant) and you can only access services within the same tenant.

#### External

It exposes the service to the public internet. It is used to expose services that need to be accessed from outside the tenant.

| Property                | Type                          |         Default          | Required |
| :-----------------------| :---------------------------- | :----------------------: | :------: |
| [`port`](#port)         | `int` (min: `0` max: `65535`) | The [target port](#port) |    ✓     |
| [`host`](#host)         | `string`                      |                          |    ✓     |
| [`protocol`](#protocol) | `http \| https \| tls`        |                          |    ✓     |

##### Port

The port property defines the port on which the service will be exposed.

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  bind:
    external:
      port: 8080
```
##### Host

The host property defines the hostname that will be used to access the service. It must be a valid **fully qualified domain name** (FQDN).

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  bind:
    external:
      host: robot-<tenant>.eu.lttle.host
```

It can also be on a custom domain that you own:

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  bind:
    external:
      host: robot.com
```

:::warning

Using a custom domain requires you to both configure the DNS records accordingly and to also validate the domain ownership. Check [Domains and DNS](#domains-and-dns) for more information.

:::

##### Protocol

States what outbound protocol the service is using. It can be either `http`, `https` or `tls`.

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  bind:
    external:
      protocol: https
```

:::tip

If you want to use `https` or `tls` you need to provide a valid certificate using the [`certificate property`](#certificate) and you need to also define a [certificate resource](./certificates.mdx).

:::

### Target

It defines what [machine](./machines.mdx) the service is pointing to.

| Property                                      | Type                           | Required |      Default       |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------: | :----------------: |
| `namespace`                                   | `string`                       |          |                    |
| `name`                                        | `string`                       |    ✓     |                    |
| `port`                                        | `int` (min: `0`, max: `65535`) |    ✓     |                    |
| `protocol`                                    | `http \| https \| tls`         |    ✓     |                    |
| [`connection-tracking`](#connection-tracking) | `connection-aware \| object`   |          | `connection-aware` |

#### Port

The port property defines the port on which the target machine is listening.

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  target:
    port: 8080
```

#### Connection Tracking

There are two types of connection tracking: `connection-aware` and `traffic-aware`.

##### Connection Aware

This is the default connection tracking strategy. It keeps the machine `ready` as long as there is an active connection to the service.

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  target:
    connection-tracking: connection-aware
```

##### Traffic Aware

This connection tracking strategy keeps the machine `ready` as long as there is traffic to the service. It is useful for workloads that do not use persistent connections, such as HTTP/1.1 without keep-alive.

### Certificate

The certificate property defines the name of the [certificate resource](./certificates.mdx) that will be used to secure the service. It is required if the service is using `https` or `tls` as protocol.

```yaml title="robot-service.lttle.yaml"
service:
  certificate: terminator-cert
```

## Domains and DNS

For development, research and testing feel free to use the `eu.lttle.host` sub-domain. For production workloads, you should use your own domain and [configure the DNS records accordingly](#configure-dns).

We are maintaining the `eu.lttle.host` sub-domain and you can use it for free. We are using a wildcard certificate for it, so you don't need to worry about certificates during the early stages of your project.

### Configure DNS

To configure your own domain for production workloads, you need to set up the DNS records to point to your services. This typically involves creating `A` records in your DNS provider's management console.

Use this IP address for the `A` records depending on the region you are using:

| Region        | IP Address      |
| :------------ | :-------------- |
| `eu` (Europe) | `46.105.65.138` |


Here is how you can set it up in cloudflare: [Cloudflare | Manage DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/).
