# Volumes

Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by machines. They are independent of the machine lifecycle, so data is not lost when a machine is stopped or deleted.

If you want to know how to deploy a volume you can check [Building & Deploying &gt; Deploying](../building-and-deploying/deploying.md).

### Name

The name is the unique identifier for your volume within a namespace. It is used to reference the volume in [machines](./machines.mdx#volumes).

<ResourceNameValidation />

### Tags

Tags are used to organize and categorize resources. They can be any valid UTF-8 string and can be used to filter resources in the [Web Console](../monitoring/web-console.md)..

```yaml title="robot.lttle.yaml"
volume:
  tags:
    - terminator
```

### Mode

It defines the access mode of the volume. It can be either `readonly` or `writable`.

```yaml title="robot.lttle.yaml"
volume:
  mode: writable
```

### Size

The size property defines the size of the volume in a [human readable string](../glossary.md#human-readable-string). The minimum size for a volume is `1KB` and the maximum size is `1GB`.

```yaml title="robot.lttle.yaml"
volume:
  size: 42MB
```

:::info

The maximum value reflects the current limitations of the underlying infrastructure and will be increased in the future.
