# Authentication

Right now the only way to authenticate is with your provided JWT token.

Once you have installed the CLI in the previous step, [Installing the CLI](./installing-the-cli.md), you can authenticate by running the following command:

```sh
lttle login --api https://eu.lttle.cloud <JWT>
```

The only supported region is `eu`.
